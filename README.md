## Getting Started

This is my playground for learning Java. I think I'm comfortable with Python, JS, and even C/C++, but not much with Java. This is the language we use at our university. So I'm learning it.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Note

Programs will mostly be basic since I want to strengthen my foundations before moving on to more advance topics.
